This is a simple todo apllication

It's have two part
    1. Api (server)
    2. Fronted (fronted)

As Database here I have used json file
    - data.json

Fetures :
    - Add todo
    - Filter todo (completed, incompleted)
    - Mark as done
    - Delete todo
    - Update todo

Process: fronted will call api server to get and update data, based on api response we are showing data in fronted.

Techology:
    - Fronted : HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, Ajax
    - Server: Node.js, Express.js, FileSystem, JSON, CORS
    - Database : Json file (data.json)
